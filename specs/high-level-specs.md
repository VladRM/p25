Below is the updated design document for **Echo-Chamber Escape**, now explicitly framed as a left‑to‑right auto‑runner. High‑level functionality notes have been added to the core concept.

1. **Game Title & Tagline**

   * **Misinformation Marathon**: “Dodge the lies. Sprint to the booth.”
   * **Truth Sprint: Simion’s Spin Cycle**: “When slogans flip, your reflexes must flip faster.”
   * **Freedom Flags Run**: “Catch the facts before they catch you.”
   * **Echo-Chamber Escape**: “Break out of the bubble—vote for reality.”

2. **Core Concept & Satirical Framing**

   * A voter races through an endless boulevard of AUR propaganda: nationalist banners, fake‑news tabloids, and glitching campaign slogans.
   * Satire is delivered through dynamic, absurd obstacles (e.g., posters that self‑transform into conspiracy pamphlets, “Freedom Flags” toggling into “Control Flags”).
   * **Movement Style (Left‑to‑Right Auto‑Runner)**

     * The player’s character runs automatically to the right at a constant pace; players cannot slow or reverse direction.
     * The camera follows the runner in a side‑scroll, creating a continuous flow of new content from the right edge.
     * Obstacles, power‑ups, and NPCs spawn off‑screen to the right and scroll left across the screen, then despawn off the left edge.
     * Parallax backgrounds shift at different speeds to reinforce a sense of depth and endless progression.
     * Player input is limited to jumping and sliding to navigate hazards, emphasizing reflexes and strategic use of power‑ups.

3. **Main Character**

   * **The Voter** represents Romania’s silent majority—caught between civic duty and propaganda overload.
   * **Abilities**:

     * **Critical Leap**: Double‑jump to clear stacks of contradictory flyers.
     * **Data Dive Slide**: Duck under rolling misinformation barrels.
     * **Fact‑Check Flashlight**: Illuminate and clear waves of false claims.
   * **Upgrades**: Civic Education Boots (higher jumps), Media Goggles (longer flashlight duration).

4. **Enemies / Obstacles**

   * **Contradictory Claims**: Posters flipping text mid‑run ("Romania First!" ↔ "Globalist Puppet!").
   * **Anti‑Vax Flyers**: Spiraling pamphlets that impede movement.
   * **Conspiracy Banners**: Ribbon streams declaring hidden agendas.
   * **Protest Mobs**: Charges that knock the player back.
   * **Fake News Headlines**: Floating tabloids that stall progress until cleared.
   * **Troll Drones**: Bots spamming pop‑up comments, requiring rapid fact‑check activation.

5. **Power‑Ups / Tools of Resistance**

   * **Critical Thinking**: Slows obstacle speed for a short window.
   * **Fact Checking**: Clears clusters of propaganda into collectible Truth Tokens.
   * **Civic Education Workshop**: Temporarily shields nearby NPCs from misinformation.
   * **Independent Media Access**: Auto‑reveals hidden traps and strengthens rescue radius.
   * **Disinformation Scanner**: Highlights camouflaged hazards on the track.

6. **Rescuable NPCs**

   * Citizens trapped in misinformation bubbles: pensioners fearing vaccines, youths spouting reunification memes, influencers sharing AUR TikToks.
   * While powered by Fact Checking or Independent Media, touching an NPC frees them—converting their misinformation icons into Enlightened statuses and boosting your final score.

7. **Visual & Audio Style**

   * **Art**: Punk pixel‑art with Eastern‑European meme motifs, glitch filters on propaganda.
   * **Palette**: High‑contrast reds/yellows for disinfo, cool blues/greens for truth moments.
   * **Sound**: Industrial‑folk mash‑ups; "lie alarms" on false claims; uplifting choral swells on rescues.

8. **Narrative Progression**

   * **Early Campaign**: Scattered, low‑speed obstacles.
   * **Annulment Shock**: Post‑disqualification frenzy, increased spawn rates and speeds.
   * **Runoff Reckoning**: Peak absurdity with nonstop social‑media surges and toughest hazards.

9. **UI Elements**

   * **Cognitive Load Bar**: Fills with each hit; empties via Critical Thinking.
   * **Disinformation Meter**: Tracks on‑screen false claims; cleared by Fact Checking.
   * **Truth Token Counter**: Shows collected tokens used to recharge tools.
   * **Rescue Gauge**: Percentage of NPCs freed, determining epilogue outcome.

10. **Win Condition & Replay Value**

* **Voting Booth Finale**: Cast a ballot; epilogue varies by civic‑health score ("Democracy Strengthened" vs. "Battle Continues").
* **Unlockables**: Hard Mode, Simion’s Spin Chaos Mode, Local Co‑op.
* **Leaderboards**: Rank by Truth Tokens and NPC rescues to encourage replay.
